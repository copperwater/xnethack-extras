-	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are

-	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
-	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
-	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
-	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
-	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
-	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
-	Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation
-	to wither.

-	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
-	basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows

-	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever

+shocking sphere
+        A magical kamikaze that attacks by exploding, damaging nearby
+        creatures, including any hapless adventurer who manages to get
+        in the way.
+
+	The attack by those who want to die -- this is the attack
+	against which you cannot prepare a perfect defense.

+# f - felines
+*cat
+*feline
+kitten
+	Well-known quadruped domestic animal from the family of
+	predatory felines (_Felis ochreata domestica_), with a thick,
+	soft pelt; often kept as a pet.  Various folklores have the
+	cat associated with magic and the gods of ancient Egypt.
+
+	So Ulthar went to sleep in vain anger; and when the people
+	awakened at dawn - behold!  Every cat was back at his
+	accustomed hearth!  Large and small, black, grey, striped,
+	yellow and white, none was missing.  Very sleek and fat did
+	the cats appear, and sonorous with purring content.
+		[ The Cats of Ulthar, by H.P. Lovecraft ]
+jaguar
+	Large, flesh-eating animal of the cat family, of Central and
+	South America.  This feline predator (_Panthera onca_) is
+	sometimes incorrectly called a panther.
+	    [ Van Dale's Groot Woordenboek der Nederlandse Taal ]
+lynx
+	To dream of seeing a lynx, enemies are undermining your
+	business and disrupting your home affairs.  For a woman,
+	this dream indicates that she has a wary woman rivaling her
+	in the affections of her lover. If she kills the lynx, she
+	will overcome her rival.
+		[ 10,000 Dreams Interpreted, by Gustavus Hindman Miller ]
+panther
+	And lo! almost where the ascent began,
+	A panther light and swift exceedingly,
+	Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er!
+
+	And never moved she from before my face,
+	Nay, rather did impede so much my way,
+	That many times I to return had turned.
+		[ Dante's Inferno, as translated
+		    by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow ]
+~tiger eye*
+tiger
+        This jungle predator is widely believed to be the largest and
+        most dangerous feline creature in the dungeon.
+
+	1.  A well-known tropical predator (_Felis tigris_): a
+	feline.  It has a yellowish skin with darker spots or
+	stripes.  2.  Figurative: _a paper tiger_, something that is
+	meant to scare, but has no really scaring effect whatsoever,
+	(after a statement by Mao Ze Dong, August 1946).

+
+	Tyger! Tyger! burning bright
+	In the forests of the night,
+	What immortal hand or eye
+	Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

+# g - gargoyles
+gremlin
+        This hideous green gargoyle-like creature multiplies in water
+        and strips away your innate magical defenses when it attacks.
+
+	Suddenly, Wilson thought about war, about the newspaper
+	stories which recounted the alleged existence of creatures in
+	the sky who plagued the Allied pilots in their duties.  They
+	called them gremlins, he remembered.  Were there, actually,
+	such beings?  Did they, truly, exist up here, never falling,
+	riding on the wind, apparently of bulk and weight, yet
+	impervious to gravity?
+	He was thinking that when the man appeared again.
+		[ Nightmare at 20,000 Feet, by Richard Matheson ]
+~wing
+gargoyle
+	Made of stone carved into hideous features, the gargoyle is inherently
+	immune to petrification, but it is just a little slower than a human.
+winged gargoyle
+	Made of stone carved into hideous features, one would think this creature
+	too heavy to fly, despite the wings.  Perhaps it flies by some magical means.
+	It is significantly faster than its wingless brethren.
+*gargoyle
+	And so it came to pass that while Man ruled on Earth, the
+	gargoyles waited, lurking, hidden from the light.  Reborn
+	every 600 years in Man's reckoning of time, the gargoyles
+	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.
+
+	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
+	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
+	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
+	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's
+	imagination.  In this year, with Man's thoughts turned toward
+	the many ills he has brought among himself, Man has forgotten
+	his most ancient adversary, the gargoyles.
