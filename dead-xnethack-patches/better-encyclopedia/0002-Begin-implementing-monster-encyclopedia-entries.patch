+# Monsters begin here, in general order of monster class.
+#
+# a - ants/insects
+giant ant
+        It is said that in the Dungeons of Doom, even the ants are large
+        enough to kill a man with their bite.
+killer bee
+        Bees, like ants, are surprisingly fast for their size. It is
+        said that they sometimes make hives, deep in the dungeon, where
+        they keep their precious royal jelly.
+soldier ant
+        Groups of these deadly insects have been responsible for the
+        deaths of many adventurers.
+fire ant
+        No one is quite sure whethere the fire ant is native to the
+        dungeon, or an invasive species.  Either way, they are just as
+        fast as their non-firey brethren, congregate in groups just as
+        large, and supplement their bite with a strange venom that burns
+        just like fire.
+giant beetle
+        One of the slower insects in the dungeon, the giant beetle is
+        tough to kill, but relatively easy to outrun.  Like many things
+        in these depths, its corpse is poisonous to eat.
+queen bee
+        Killer bees form colonies centered around a queen.  Faster and
+        more dangerous than her workers, the queen is often found in the
+        hive, guarding the precious royal jelly.
+# b - blobs
+acid blob
+        It is not known how a blob of acid can move around on its own.
+        Perhaps it is the result of some wizard's arcane experiments.
+quivering blob
+        A strange animated blob of protoplasm, this amoeba-like creature
+        is slow and not very dangerous.
+gelatinous cube
+        The strange gelatinous substance of which this creature is
+        composed can paralyze the unwary adventurer who touches, or is
+        touched by, the cube.  However, this only happens if the cube is
+        still alive.  Once killed, its corpse can be safely touched,
+        although it is acidic to eat.  Gelatinous cubes absorb objects
+        that they find in the dungeon.  Durable objects may be recovered
+        if the cube is killed, but organic materials are dissolved.
