Subject: [PATCH] Add many new entries for just about every item in the game

Entries are copied from FIQHack's encyclopedia, which should be just
about the same as NetHack4's. Some key differences:

1. xNetHack has object lookup, meaning that a lot of text-based info
from NH4 is pointlessly repetitive. Examples include qualifying every
food item in terms of apples (lookup shows the exact amount of
nutrition), comparing weapons to other weapons qualitatively and
speaking in general terms about small and large damage (lookup shows
this as well), and language such as "protecting against the special
attacks of monsters" for magic cancellation.

2. Object materials in descriptions are removed wherever possible and
reasonable, since we don't want to mislead anyone.

3. Descriptions relating to the invocation ritual are somewhat
changed, mainly because something feels off about the original ones to
me - perhaps the overuse of the word "special" and general beating
around the bush. With the current structure they're upfront about the
existence of an invocation ritual, whose entry describes exactly what is
needed, but only in the formally identified entries.

4. Entirely new entries: thiefstone, ring of carrying, invocation.

5. Unidentified descriptions for items that don't randomize their
descriptions are just listed under that item and share an entry with it.

6. Quotations are kept (unlike in NH4); some are moved around as
necessary.  For instance, *unicorn and unicorn horn were split up, with
one of each of its two quotes going to each entry.

7. Japanese item names are merged into the regular base item names
unless they had a good quotation.

+amulet of change
+	Created as a practical joke by some whimsical wizard, it causes its
+	wearer to change from male to female or vice versa; to prevent the
+	victim simply using it again to change back, it disintegrates upon
+	causing such a transformation.
+amulet of esp
+	It allows its wearer to sense nearby minds, giving them an idea of
+	which intelligent creatures are nearby; the range of this telepathy is
+	much greater if the wearer is blindfolded or otherwise protected from
+	visual distractions.
+amulet of life saving
+	It prevents the wearer's death or permanent disablement. For instance,
+	it can heal lethal wounds, cure deadly diseases, or reverse the
+        transformation of its wearer into a statue; but it can avert nearly
+        any other cause of death, too.  If worn, it activates automatically
+        when its wearer would die. However, the strain of saving a life
+        completely destroys the amulet, and recovering from the dead makes
+        most creatures permanently less healthy.
+amulet of magical breathing
+	It acts as an air supply (or a supply of oxygenated water for
+	water-breathing wearers), meaning that the wearer can survive even in
+	environments in which they could not normally breathe.
+amulet of reflection
+	It reflects most visible rays and gaze attacks aimed at its wearer,
+	sending them back towards the creature that created them.
+amulet of restful sleep
+	It sometimes, at random, makes its wearer unexpectedly fall into a
+	peaceful sleep; comfortable, but potentially dangerous if there are
+	monsters around at the time.
+amulet of strangulation
+	It prevents its wearer breathing, usually leading to a rapid death if
+	it is not removed quickly.
+amulet of unchanging
+	It protects the wearer from effects that would change their form into
+        that of a different creature; or, if the wearer is already
+        transformed, prevents them turning back. Note that this also prevents
+        a polymorphed body automatically turning back to survive a lethal
+        injury, so it should be used with caution.

+potion of confusion
+        This potion makes its drinker confused, unable to think
+        straight, talk straight, and occasionally even unable to walk
+        straight. The effect wears off eventually, but not for a long
+        time.
+potion of enlightenment
+        Drinking this potion gives its drinker a glimpse of

+potion of gain ability
+        This magical potion permanently makes its drinker stronger, more
+        dexterous, healthier, more intelligent, wiser, or more
+        attractive.
+potion of gain energy
+        This potion contains magical energy; drinking it slightly
+        increases the amount of magical power its wearer's body can
+        store, as well as partially refilling their reservoir of power.
+potion of gain level
+        This potion contains liquid knowledge, magically and instantly
+        making its drinker more skillful, experienced, and better in
+        combat and at magic.
+potion of hallucination
+        This potion interferes with the mind and senses, giving its
+        drinker a completely warped sense of reality where they cannot
+        distinguish between monsters even as different as a dragon and
+        an ant.
+potion of healing
+        This potion quickly patches up its drinker's minor wounds,
+        leading to a relatively small amount of instant healing. Healing
+        potions might sometimes cure status problems too, depending on
+        the problem and the strength of the potion.
+potion of invisibility
+        This potion turns its drinker invisible; the invisibility field
+        extends out from the body to some extent, making their equipment
+        invisible as well. The effect is usually temporary.
+potion of levitation
+        This potion lifts its drinker into the air, allowing them to
+        float across water and over pits, but leaving them unable to
+        reach the ground or move downstairs. The effect wears off after
+        a while, which can be fatal if it happens over water.
+potion of monster detection
+        This potion alerts its drinker to the locations of monsters; the
+        ability to detect monsters has a long range, but does not work
+        upwards or downwards, only sideways.
+potion of object detection
+        The drinker of this potion gets a sudden insight as to the
+        location of all the treasure on their level, knowing what sort
+        of object is where.
+potion of oil
+        The bottle contains non-magical oil, which can be ignited to act
+        as a makeshift light source, or an even more makeshift thrown
+        weapon.
+potion of paralysis
+        Drinking this dangerous potion leaves its drinker unable to move
+        or react in any way for a while, during which time they are
+        rather vulnerable.
+potion of polymorph
+        This potion causes anyone who drinks it, or any item dipped into
+        it, to instantly change to a new form. Polymorph can be a
+        dangerous effect, often having serious side effects and
+        sometimes being even lethal to inexperienced drinkers.
+potion of restore ability
+        This potion reverses the effects of poisons that weaken the
+        body, and effects that drain its drinker's abilities, restoring
+        attributes up to their previous maximum values.
+potion of see invisible
+        This potion magically enhances its drinker's vision, allowing
+        them to see even invisible monsters. The effect is usually
+        temporary.
+potion of sickness
+        This contaminated potion is poisonous; drinking it is a bad
+        idea, although it can be used to coat some types of small
+        projectiles for use poisoning enemies.
+potion of sleeping
+        This potion instantly causes its drinker to fall asleep. They
+        wake naturally after a while, or might wake due to noise,
+        injury, or other similar reasons.

+ring of adornment
+        It adjusts its wearer's status in the eyes of others, making

+ring of aggravate monster
+        It annoys nearby monsters, making hostile monsters more likely
+        to notice the wearer's presence, and even tame monsters less
+        willing to forgive maltreatment.
+ring of carrying

+        support it provides increases the more highly enchanted it is.
+ring of cold resistance
+        It protects its wearer (and their equipment) almost perfectly
+        from the effects of cold and low temperatures.
+ring of conflict
+        It angers creatures near one who wears it, making them attack
+        anything and everything in a furious rage, even creatures that
+        they would normally never dream of attacking; thus, it might be
+        a useful distraction, but might also cause otherwise peaceful
+        monsters to turn on its wearer. Some monsters may resist the
+        effect, at least some of the time.

+ring of gain constitution
+        It adjusts its wearer's constitution, making them healthier the

+ring of gain strength
+        It adjusts its wearer's strength, making them beefier the more
+        highly enchanted it is.
+ring of hunger
+        It is flawed in its manufacture, taking a large amount of
+        nutrition from its wearer's body to power itself, but failing to
+        give any benefit.
+ring of increase accuracy
+        It adjusts its wearer's aim, making them more accurate the more

+        floating over pits and water, but unable to reach the ground to
+        pick up items or to go down stairs.
+ring of poison resistance
+        It completely protects its wearer from the effects of most
+        poisons, including poisonous food, but not food mouldy with age;
+        food poisoning is actually a sort of illness.
+ring of polymorph
+        It is powered by uncontrolled wild magic, occasionally randomly
+        turning the wearer into a different type of creature, which
+        could be very similar or very different. Radical changes will
+        wear off over time, or automatically change back if the new form
+        is fatally injured; slight changes (to a different member of the
+        same race), though, will be permanent. The shock of the repeated
+        changes can sometimes kill inexperienced wearers, so this ring
+        can be risky to use.
+ring of polymorph control
+        It allows its wearer some degree of control over effects that
+        would change their form, allowing them to select what sort of
+        new form to change into with a very good chance of success.
+ring of protection
+        It adjusts its wearer's resistance to blows, making it harder to
+        injure them the more highly enchanted it is.
+ring of protection from shape changers
+        While worn, it forces nearby shape-changing monsters into their
+        natural form, making them incapable of shifting into more
+        dangerous forms or hiding from the wearer disguised as something
+        else.
+ring of regeneration
+        It causes its wearer to heal more quickly, although it takes
+        more than the usual amount of food energy from its wearer to
+        power it.
+ring of searching
+        It sometimes warns the wearer about nearby traps or secret
+        doors, working as well as if the wearer were stopping every turn
+        to search the surrounding area, but without the need for the
+        wearer to actually stop and search.
+ring of shock resistance
+        It protects its wearer (and their equipment) almost perfectly
+        from the effects of electricity and lightning.
+ring of slow digestion
+        It provides its wearer with enough energy that they need
+        metabolise no food themselves, although the wearer's food
+        supplies are still needed to power the rings and amulets they
+        wear, and even this ring itself takes a bit of food to power its
+        own effect, so occasional eating is still necessary.
+ring of stealth
+        It reduces the noise made by its wearer's movements, allowing
+        them to slip past sleeping monsters without waking them up.
+ring of sustain ability
+        It protects its wearer's abilities from changes, making them
+        basically impossible to change; although useful to prevent
+        abilities being drained, it unfortunately also prevents them
+        improving naturally.
+ring of teleport control
+        It allows the wearer to control where otherwise random
+        teleportation effects would cause them to land, or choose to
+        avoid teleporting entirely, although it grants no ability by
+        itself to cause teleports to happen.
+ring of teleportation
+        It randomly teleports its wearer every now and then; some
+        particularly experienced, and maybe magically gifted, wearers
+        will be able to control when it teleports, but other wearers
+        will just have to live with the whims of the uncontrolled wild
+        magic that powers the ring. Additional magic is required to be
+        able to choose the targets of the teleports.
+ring of warning
+        It warns the wearer of the existence of potentially dangerous

+        friendly.
+scroll of destroy armor
+        When read, it destroys a piece of armor worn by its reader. It's
+        not entirely clear why this scroll was invented in the first
+        place; the leading theory is that some wizard used it as an
+        ingenious practical joke.
+scroll of earth
+        When read, it causes boulders to fall from the ceiling, around
+        and/or above its reader.
+scroll of enchant armor
+        When read, it magically enhances a random piece of armor worn by
+        its reader to become more protective. Beware; enchanting armor
+        too far may destroy it.
+scroll of enchant weapon
+        It magically enhances weapons held in its reader's hands to be
+        more accurate and more damaging. Note that there is a limit to
+        how much enchantment weapons will stand; enchanting weapons too
+        far may destroy them.
+scroll of fire
+        This rather dangerous scroll explodes in a ball of fire when
+        read; as its reader tends to be at the center of the blast,
+        reading it can be rather unwise. In certain circumstances, the
+        fireball can instead be targeted a short distance away.
+scroll of food detection
+        When read, this scroll informs its reader of the locations of
+        everything edible on the current level. Note that just because
+        it is possible to eat something, that does not necessarily mean
+        that it is safe to eat.
+scroll of genocide
+        When read, this feared and dreaded scroll permanently and
+        irreversibly erases a chosen type of monster from existence,
+        such that from then on it exists only as a memory. Many powerful
+        species of monster are under divine protection, and thus unable
+        to be chosen.
+scroll of gold detection
+        Loved by the greedy, this scroll pinpoints the location of all
+        the gold on the current level when read.
+scroll of identify
+        When read, this highly useful scroll informs its reader as to
+        the exact purpose and enchantment of a chosen item (or possibly
+        more than one item) in their inventory.
+scroll of light
+        Reading it causes the nearby area to permanently glow with
+        magical light.
+scroll of magic mapping
+        Reading the words on this scroll gives their reader a mental
+        image of a map of the current level; some levels are either
+        magically protected from mapping, or too bizarre to successfully
+        map, but in most cases the scroll will work correctly.
+scroll of mail
+stamped scroll
+	It contains a message from beyond the dungeon.
+scroll of punishment
+        Reading it attracts punishments from the gods; an incautious
+        reader can end up chained to a heavy iron ball.
+scroll of remove curse
+        It lifts curses from its reader's equipment, or maybe even all
+        of their belongings if it is first empowered with a holy aura.
+scroll of scare monster
+        Most monsters cannot bear to hear the words on this scroll
+        spoken aloud, nor bear to read such a scroll lying on the
+        ground, and will flee from it. Such scrolls tend to be fragile
+        and will not survive being repeatedly lifted and dropped.
+scroll of stinking cloud
+        When read, it creates a large cloud of poison gas nearby; its
+        reader can choose where it is located, and although it must be
+        relatively near, it can be placed so that its reader is not
+        caught in the blast.
+scroll of taming
+        The words on this scroll try to magically influence the minds of
+        nearby monsters when read out loud, trying to make them change
+        sides and cooperate with their reader. The success rate is far
+        from perfect, though.
+scroll of teleportation
+        Reading it instantly transports the wearer to a different
+        location. Often the teleportation will be to somewhere random,
+        but it might be possible to influence the destination with
+        independent magic, or by having the scroll empowered with a holy
+        aura.

+spell*cancellation
+        This powerful spell completely removes magical effects or
+        abilities from items or monsters in a chosen direction. Many
+        monsters are capable of resisting such effects, though, at least
+        some of the time.
+spell*cause fear
+        This spell causes monsters to want to run away rather than
+        fight. It is not infallible, though.
+spell*charm monster
+        This spell makes nearby monsters friendly to the caster,
+        although not with a perfect chance of success. It is more likely
+        to work with more powerful casters and with less magic-resistant
+        monsters. If it does work, the effect is permanent unless
+        something is done to abuse the affected monsters.
+spell*clairvoyance
+        This spell maps a small area around the caster, showing what the
+        local terrain is like.
+spell*cone of cold
+        This spell shoots a ray of frost in a chosen direction; more
+        skilled casters will instead create a freezing explosion at a
+        certain nearby location.
+spell*confuse monster
+        This spell causes its caster's hands to glow red, imbuing them
+        with an energy that will confuse the next (or next several)
+        monsters they touch with the glowing hands.
+spell*create familiar
+        This powerful spell, developed by the same mages who originally
+        developed "create monster", creates a tame monster to serve as
+        the caster's pet. For some reason, it often creates common
+        domestic animals, although more often than not it will create a
+        monster common in the local environment instead.
+spell*create monster
+        This spell creates a monster, or possibly several monsters,
+        nearby; unfortunately, the research behind the spell is
+        incomplete, meaning that the resulting monsters are typically
+        hostile, and attack the caster who created them, although
+        peaceful creatures are created on occasion.
+spell*cure blindness
+        This spell instantly cures all forms of blindness that might be
+        affecting its caster, although it cannot remove a blindfold or
+        similar piece of equipment that might prevent sight.
+spell*cure sickness
+        This spell instantly cures all forms of sickness and illness
+        affecting its caster.
+spell*detect food
+        This spell alerts its caster to the locations and identities of
+        nearby items of food.
+spell*detect monsters
+        This spell alerts its caster to the locations and identities of
+        monsters on the current level. Although for most casters such an
+        insight only lasts an instant, skilled casters can prolong the
+        spell to last considerably longer.
+spell*detect treasure
+        This spell reveals the locations of items on the current level,
+        and even some clues as to their identities.
+spell*detect unseen
+        This spell reveals the existence of secret, hidden or invisible
+        monsters or terrain nearby.
+spell*dig
+        This spell fires a magical ray that is harmless to creatures,
+        but which destroys walls easily, leaving behind a tunnel large
+        enough to walk in.
+spell*drain life
+        The dark energy of this spell (which can be aimed in a chosen
+        direction) drains away some of the life energy of a creature it
+        hits, or maybe some of the magical energy of an object,
+        weakening it. However, it can be resisted, and does not affect
+        creatures that are not alive.
+spell*extra healing
+        This extra-powerful healing spell, about twice as powerful as a
+        basic healing spell, cures wounds suffered by the caster, or by
+        a monster in a chosen direction.
+spell*finger of death
+        This dreaded spell shoots a ray of pure radiative energy that
+        instantly kills anything it hits; the only protections against
+        it are dodging the ray, absorbing it with certain types of
+        magical protection, and being dead already (or at least
+        non-alive). If an unwise caster aims this spell at him or
+        herself, not even magical protection will help.
+spell*fireball
+        This spell shoots a ray of flame in a chosen direction; more
+        skilled casters will instead create a fiery explosion at a
+        chosen nearby location.
+spell*force bolt
+        This basic attack spell shoots a small discontinuity of force in
+        a chosen direction; it is moderately good at attacking
+        creatures, but particularly
+	destructive against many sorts of inanimate objects.
+spell*haste self
+        This spell invigorates its caster's movements, making them move
+        and act much more quickly than normal for a while.
+spell*healing
+        This is a simple healing spell, which can cure small wounds to
+        some extent.  Its caster can either use it to heal him or
+        herself, or shoot it in a chosen direction to heal another
+        creature.
+spell*invisibility
+        This spell turns its caster temporarily invisible, meaning that
+        they can be seen only by monsters with some other method of
+        detecting their location. The effect wears off after a while.
+spell*jumping
+        This spell allows its caster to immediately once make a
+        surprisingly long jump, landing a long distance away; it can
+        lead to very fast movement, as the jumps take a comparable
+        length of time to ordinary movement.
+spell*knock
+        This spell magically and instantly unlocks locks, fastenings and
+        similar restraints in a chosen direction, allowing a person (or
+        maybe just gravity) to easily open whatever was being locked or
+        fastened.
+spell*levitation
+        This spell causes its caster to float in midair, unable to reach
+        the ground, which can be useful for avoiding ground-based
+        hazards. Unfortunately, it takes substantial skill to
+        subsequently be able to determine how long the spell lasts, with
+        only skilled casters being able to guarantee it lasts more than
+        a few turns, and end it when they want; less skilled casters are
+        stuck in midair until the effect ends, which might be almost
+        immediately or not for a long time.
+spell*light
+        This spell causes the surrounding area to permanently shine with
+        magical light, revealing anything that might be trying to hide
+        under the cover of darkness.
+spell*magic mapping
+        This spell gives its caster a mental image of a map of the
+        current level; note that some areas may be either magically
+        warded against mapping, or just too bizarre to be able to map
+        like that.
+spell*magic missile
+        This spell shoots a ray made out of bullets of magical energy in
+        a chosen direction. More experienced casters will do
+        substantially more damage with this spell.
+spell*polymorph
+        This spell, which can be cast to affect the caster or objects or
+        monsters in a chosen direction, causes random changes to their
+        form; neither objects nor creatures always survive such changes,
+        and anything might resist this rather unpredictable spell.
+spell*protection
+        This spell summons a golden haze around its caster, which can
+        sometimes turn aside attacks, making them harder to hit in
+        combat. The effect wears off relatively quickly, though.
+spell*remove curse
+        This spell lifts the effects of curses from its caster's
+        equipment; for more skilled casters, it can even affect the rest
+        of their inventory.
+spell*restore ability
+        This spell recovers damage to its caster's abilities, that may
+        have been suffered due to things like poison. Less skilled
+        casters may need to cast it multiple times to fully restore all
+        such damage.
+spell*sleep
+        This spell shoots a ray of sleep energy in a chosen direction,
+        making monsters hit by it tend to fall asleep. Many monsters may
+        resist, though, and some (especially those which do not sleep
+        naturally) are immune to it.
+spell*slow monster
+        This spell slows, or permanently dispels effects which speed, a
+        monster in a chosen direction. It cannot affect items that speed
+        creatures up, though.
+spell*stone to flesh
+        This spell turns rock in a chosen direction into meat; it can be
+        used to reverse the effects of being turned to stone, or just as
+        a way to make random rocks edible. Walls are too large to be
+        affected by such a spell, and must be chopped into smaller
+        pieces first.
+spell*teleport away
+        This spell causes the caster, or a monster or object in a chosen
+        direction, to be randomly moved elsewhere on the same level;
+        although this spell itself has no way to control which location,
+        other magic may be able to control such random teleportation.
+spell*turn undead
+        This spell, developed for combating the walking dead, scares and
+        damages such monsters in a chosen direction using an imposing
+        beam of life energy. This sort of magic has been known to have
+        side effects on certain objects which were once living.
+spell*wizard lock
+        This spell ensures that a chest, large box or doorway in a
+        chosen direction is closed and locked; it will repair or create
+        a door and/or a lock, if necessary, to achieve this.
+splint mail
+        A suit of body armour made out of vertical strips riveted
+        together, providing extremely good protection against attack,
+        almost as good as plate mail.

+wand of cancellation
+        Zapping it at a monster or item removes its magical abilities,
+        although some items and monsters may completely or partially
+        resist. It also removes some other sorts of lingering magical
+        effects, such as enchantments and curses.
+wand of create monster
+        Zapping it creates one, or occasionally more, monsters.
+        Unfortunately, they are quite likely to be hostile, and so the
+        wand is mostly only good if you're looking for a fight.
+wand of cold
+        Zapping it produces a ray of cold that freezes all it touches.
+        The ray is capable of bouncing off walls, but has only a limited
+        range.
+wand of death
+        This dreaded wand's zaps produce rays that kill all they touch,
+        although they have no effect on monsters that are dead already.
+        The ray is capable of bouncing off walls, but has only a limited
+        range.
+wand of digging
+        Zapping it at a wall or floor creates a tunnel big enough to
+        walk through. If you take out the ground beneath your feet,
+        you'd better expect to fall.
+wand of enlightenment
+        Zapping it informs the one who zapped it of their own magical
+        powers, and of their god's opinion of them.
+wand of fire
+        Zapping it produces a ray of fire that burns all it touches. The
+        ray is capable of bouncing off walls, but has only a limited
+        range.
+wand of light
+        Zapping it permanently lights up the area near where it was
+        zapped.
+wand of lightning
+        Zapping it produces a ray of lightning, that bounces off walls,
+        but has only a limited range. In addition to electrifying things
+        it hits, the ray is bright enough to cause temporary blindness.
+wand of magic missile
+        Zapping it at a monster barrages it with magically produced
+        bullets. The damage output is somewhat underwhelming, though.
+        The ray produced by this wand is capable of bouncing off walls,
+        although it has only a limited range.
+wand of make invisible
+        Zapping it at a person or monster causes it to turn invisible,
+        permanently. You can use it on yourself, but you might have some
+        trouble being seen.
+wand of nothing
+        Although zapping it seems to have a magical effect, it isn't one
+        that accomplishes anything.
+wand of opening
+        Zapping it at a lock causes it to unlock instantly, whether the
+        lock is on a door, a container, or something else. It might be
+        able to open other things, too.
+wand of polymorph
+        Zapping it at a monster or item causes it to change into a
+        different type of monster or item, although items tend to change
+        into similar sorts of item.  This sort of magic is relatively
+        uncontrolled, and sometimes works in unintended ways, perhaps
+        damaging or destroying its target, or accidentally making an
+        item into a monster.
+wand of probing
+        Zapping it at a monster reveals some information about it, such
+        as its current hitpoint count and inventory. It can determine
+        the inventory of containers, too.
+wand of secret door detection
+        Zapping it alerts the one who zapped it to the location of
+        concealed dungeon features, such as secret doors, traps, and
+        portals, nearby.
+wand of sleep
+        Zapping it produces a soporific ray that causes monsters it hits
+        to fall asleep. The ray can bounce off walls, but has only a
+        limited range.
+wand of slow monster
+        Zapping it at a monster causes it to slow down, acting in slow
+        motion, and thus make it easier to run from and perform fewer
+        attacks. Many monsters can resist the effects, though, with
+        varying chances of doing so.
+wand of speed monster
+        Zapping it causes its target to become temporarily much faster.
+wand of striking
+        Zapping it creates a force bolt that may hit everything in a
+        chosen direction, doing moderate damage to creatures and huge
+        damage to many sorts of inanimate object.
+wand of teleportation
+        Anything it is zapped at is instantly teleported to a different
+        square on the same level. Although you can aim this wand at
+        yourself, some unusual environments make it impossible for a
+        person to teleport deliberately. The square on which the
+        teleport ends will be random, unless separate magic is used to
+        be able to control it.
+wand of undead turning
+        Zapping it causes undead monsters in a chosen direction to
+        either flee in fear, or possibly even be destroyed completely.
+        This sort of magic often has unintended side effects on things
+        other than undead that were once alive.
+wand of wishing
+        This incredibly valuable wand, which can only be recharged once
+        and which can hold at most three charges at a time, grants
+        anyone who zaps it the ability to wish for an item, or stack of
+        similar items, of their choice. Almost anything can be
+        requested, although the wand may find it difficult or impossible
+        to make certain artifacts. Other properties of the items, such
+        as enchantments, may also be specified, but might not be
+        received.
